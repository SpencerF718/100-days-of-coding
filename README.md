# 100-days-of-coding

## Details

This repo contains my **100 Days of Coding** challenge, starting **May 18, 2025** and ending **August 26, 2025**.
The goal of this project is to build approximately 15 projects (one project per week) and to commit daily.

## How to View

Each project will have a corresponding folder within this repo (i.e. Project #1 - Maze Solver).
Within each project folder, there will be a README that details the project.

## Project List
